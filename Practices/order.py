# TE 2nd Order Up
#Create a program that allows a user to order items off a menu. 
# Menu items need to be stored in a dictionary with their prices as the value. 
# Users need to be able to order a drink, a main course and two side dishes. 
# At the end the program needs to repeat back to the user their full order, and the total cost.
