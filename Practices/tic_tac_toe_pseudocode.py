# TE 2nd Tic-Tac-Toe in Pseudocode.

# import random for a random number generator to select a box to put an O in.

# Loop to loop the game if the user wants to keep going:
    # Board is also a list with the numbers
    # Board is displayed as [1],[2],[3] one line down [4],[5],[6]one line down [7],[8],[9]
    #Loop for player an computer turn:
        # Computer variable is set to a random integer between 1 & 9
        # Player variable is set to an input where the player chooses a number on the gameboard
        # If player selects a number in game board change it to O
        # If computer selects number in game board change it to X 
    
    # If player gets [1],[2],[3] then thy win
    # If player gets [4],[5],[6] then they win
    # If player gets [7],[8],[9] then they win
    
    # If player gets [1],[5],[9] then they win
    # If player gets [7],[5],[3] then they win
    
    # If player gets [1],[4],[7] then they win
    # If player gets [2],[5],[8] then they win
    # If player gets [3],[6],[9] then they win

    # If computer gets [1],[2],[3] then thy win
    # If computer gets [4],[5],[6] then they win
    # If comuter gets [7],[8],[9] then they win
    
    # If computer gets [1],[5],[9] then they win
    # If computer gets [7],[5],[3] then they win
    
    # If computer gets [1],[4],[7] then they win
    # If computer gets [2],[5],[8] then they win
    # If computer gets [3],[6],[9] then they win
    # If this has looped 3 times then break while loop and ask player if they want to exit or keep going.
